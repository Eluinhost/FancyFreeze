FancyFreeze
===========

Supports Spigot 1.8 R1-3, 1.9 R1-2, 1.10 R1 and 1.12.2

Fancy freeze commands.  

A frozen player cannot:

- Interact with blocks/entities
- Deal or receive damage
- Use portals
- Drink or be splashed by potions

The player will be surrounded by fancy particles:

Stepping outside of the boundary will teleport the player back to the initial freeze location with some more particle
effects. All particle effects are only visible to the player that is frozen.

A player that is frozen will also be sent 'fake' potion effects depending on configuration: slowness, jump boost, 
blindness and mining fatigue. When they are unfrozen these potion effects are removed and any overwritten potion effects 
are sent back to the player.

Players with `uhc.fancyfreeze.antifreeze` (default op) will be unaffected by freeze commands

When the [UHC plugin](https://github.com/Eluinhost/UHC) is installed it will add an icon to `/uhc` that when clicked
will toggle global freeze and `/ffg` will show messags using the UHC styles. Enabled status will also carry across 
server reload/restarts.

# Commands

## `/ff <name> [on|off]`

Freeze/unfreeze a specific player

`<name>` - the player to be frozen/unfrozen

`[on|off]` - optional, if not supplied will toggle.

When a player is frozen with this method they will not be unfrozen with global unfreeze `/ffg` and will only be unfrozen
via this command

Permission: `uhc.fancyfreeze.command.player` default OP

## `/ffg [on|off]`

Sets global freeze on/off. If on/off is not supplied it will toggle instead. All players are frozen + any new logins.

Permission: `uhc.fancyfreeze.command.global` default OP
